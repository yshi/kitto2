# Kitto<sup>2</sup>
Welcome to Kitto<sup>2</sup>, a completely free virtual pet game framework for you to build upon, updated for the modern era. This is a successor to [KittoKittoKitto](https://github.com/OwlManAtt/KittoKittoKitto).

## What is Kitto?
Kitto is designed in the hopes that people will use it as a basis for their game. You are expected to hack at the code and add new features to your installation, turning it into your own unique game.

Out of the box, it includes the same features as the original Kitto:

- An account system, including:
  - Registration (with optional CAPTCHA), login, logout, & password reset
  - Roles & permission groups, for staff powers
  - Optional 2FA (using TOTP)
  - Search
- Pet management, including:
  - Adopt a member of a pet species in any available colour
  - With support for locked-down colours only available via paintbrush items
  - Hunger/happiness levels
  - Pet profiles
  - Abandonment
- An inventory system, including:
  - Stacking items (6 red apples = one item entry)
  - Four item types - food, toys, paintbrushes, and recipes
  - NPC shops with restocks
  - Crafting, to create a new item with recipes and ingredients
- Forums, including:
  - Custom avatars, signatures, and titles
  - Locked-down announcement boards, for staff to post news
  - Sticky/locked threads
  - Delete/edit posts/threads
  - The full power of HTML can be utilized for post mark-up - **safely**. A rich text editor is available to make adding flair to posts easy.
- Private messaging, with multiple recipients
- Event notifications (with bulk event deletion)
- An admin panel to manage everything!

## How do I get started?
You will need a server with PHP 8.2 or newer, a PostgreSQL database, and some ancillary services.

ðŸš§ There will be documentation on installation, one day ...
